# Using Neural Nets to find the ground state energy of a quantum system

## Wavefunctions
    Each system is comprised of n particles with spins of |0> or |1>. so the basis
     vectors of the system are |01010....> and so on. there are 2^n basis vectors.
     An induvidual wavefunction can be represented by how much of each basis vector is
     inside of it, each basis vector v_i gets a coeficient c_i. So, the wavefunction /Psi is 
     represented as (c_0, c_1, .... c_2^n)
